# Gem Catcher - A MonoGame Project

## 🏆 Overview
Gem Catcher is a fun and engaging arcade-style game built using MonoGame. In this game, gems fall from the sky, and the player must use a paddle to catch them. Missing a gem results in a game over, so precision and quick reflexes are key to achieving a high score!
